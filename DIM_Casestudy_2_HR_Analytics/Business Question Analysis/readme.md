 ```python
  # You can install the library using cmd, with pip install pypyodbc

import pyodbc as  odbc
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# What driver do you want to access
driver = "{SQL Server}"

# What server name do you want to connect, you can easily get this with: SELECT @@SERVERNAME;
server = "LAPTOP\SQLEXPRESS"

# What database are you interested in connecting, I am interested in my Data in Motion case study
database = "DATA_IN_MOTION"

## Question 1
*Find the longest ongoing project for each department*
 
  ```python
sql = """SELECT 
        B.name AS department,
        DATEDIFF(day,A.start_date, A.end_date) AS date_difference
        FROM projects A
        LEFT JOIN departments B
        ON A.department_id = B.id
        GROUP BY A.id, B.name, A.start_date, A.end_date;"""
 
df = pd.read_sql_query(sql, connr)
df.head()
  ```
 
## Question 2
*Find all employees who are not managers*
 
  ```python
sql = """SELECT 
            B.name AS department,
            A.name,
            A.hire_date,
            A.job_title
        FROM employees A

## Question 3
*Find all employees who have been hired after the start of a project in their department*
 
  ```python
sql = """WITH CTE AS (
            SELECT 
                department_id,
                -- Note, minimum was used here as the objective doesn't specify what 
                -- project date to be focused on
                MIN(start_date) AS project_start
            FROM projects

## Question 4
*Rank employees within each department based on their hire date (earliest hire gets the highest rank)*
 
  ```python
sql = """
        SELECT 
            B.name AS department,
            A.job_title,

        ON A.department_id = B.id;
        """

## Question 5
*Find the duration between the hire date of each employee and the hire date of the next employee hired in the same department*
 
  ```python
sql = """

        DATEDIFF(MONTH, A.hire_date, LEAD(A.hire_date) OVER(PARTITION BY B.name ORDER BY A.hire_date
        ASC)) AS date_diff
